# -Deploy-Static-Website-on-AWS

The whole project has two major intentions to implement:

**  Hosting a static website on S3 and
**  Accessing the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service. Recall that CloudFront offers low latency and high transfer speeds during website rendering.
In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS by performing the following steps:

**  I created a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket.
**  I configured the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies.
**  I sped up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.
**  I accessed my website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint
